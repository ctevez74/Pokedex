# Pokedex Challenge
Pokedex Challenge is a example Pokedex app written in Swift that implements the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co).  

This sample app demonstrates:
The consumption of two apis to get a list of items to be displayed in a list and a detail of each item.
The search system was implemented to find an item in the list.
The results are persisted using CoreData and if you do not have an internet connection, the listing is completed from the stored data.
